# breezy-buoys


## TODO

* Add apparent wind
  * First attempt resulted in a feedback loop.
* Remove lift force wind hits the luff of the sail before the leech
* Visualize wind direction
* Visualize apparent wind direction
* Visualize current speed
* Have sail area be a factor in lift & drag forces
* Add in buoys to race around
* Track laps

## Done

* Force sail lift force to always be away from the mainsheet
* Add rotational force from wind to sail
* Control sail via mainsheet instead of direct control
* Move the mainsheet attachment point from the boat component to the sail component
  (This would allow a single boat to have multiple sails with their own attachment points)
